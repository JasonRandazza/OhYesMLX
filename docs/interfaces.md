# Module interfaces

Pinned so modules can be built concurrently without inventing mismatched shapes.
**These signatures are the contract.** If one is wrong, say so in the ticket and stop —
do not quietly change it, because three other modules are being written against it.

All types are plain dataclasses or dicts. Stdlib only.

## `ohyesmlx/transport.py` — issue #2

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Observation:
    """One measured request."""
    ok: bool
    error: str | None
    ttft_s: float | None            # send -> first CONTENT delta. Reasoning deltas excluded.
    last_content_s: float | None    # send -> final content delta
    total_s: float                  # send -> stream closed
    prompt_tokens: int | None       # from usage
    completion_tokens: int | None   # from usage, content only
    reasoning_tokens: int | None    # from usage.completion_tokens_details, if present
    content_event_count: int
    text: str                       # CONTENT deltas only
    reasoning_text: str             # reasoning deltas joined; "" when the model emitted none
    token_source: str               # "usage" | "local_tokenizer" | "none"

def chat(base_url: str, model: str, messages: list[dict], *,
         max_tokens: int, temperature: float = 0.0, seed: int | None = None,
         timeout_s: float = 600.0, api_key: str | None = None,
         token_counter: "TokenCounter | None" = None) -> Observation: ...
```

`base_url` is `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1`. Streaming is always on internally with
`stream_options.include_usage`; `Observation` is what the caller sees.

**`api_key` must be wired at every call site.** oMLX refuses an unauthenticated
`/v1/chat/completions` with HTTP 401 and `Runtime.api_key()` already supplies the key the
runtime was started with. A measured run that never sends it measures nothing.

**Reasoning deltas are captured, never dropped.** A reasoning model can spend an entire
response in the reasoning channel and emit no content at all — and that reasoning text can
itself be token salad. `reasoning_text` is what lets the coherence gate see it. mlx-lm
0.31.3 spells the field `delta.reasoning`; other servers spell it `delta.reasoning_content`.
Both are read.

**`token_counter` must be wired at every call site.** In the predecessor project the exact
token path existed, was never passed by any production caller, and
`median_decode_tokens_per_second` was therefore `None` in 100% of runs on disk.

```python
class TokenCounter:            # ohyesmlx/token_counter.py
    def __init__(self, model_dir: str): ...
    def count(self, text: str) -> int: ...
```

## `ohyesmlx/runtimes.py` — issue #3

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Runtime:
    name: str                      # "mlxlm" | "osaurus" | "omlx" | "optiq"
    port: int
    def start(self, artifact_dir: str, model_id: str) -> "Handle": ...

@dataclass
class Handle:
    pid: int
    port: int
    base_url: str                  # "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1"
    model_id: str                  # what THIS runtime calls the model
    version: str                   # runtime version, recorded as provenance
    cold_load_s: float             # spawn -> ready. Its own metric, never folded in.
    def stop(self) -> None: ...    # must not return until the port is free

RUNTIMES: dict[str, Runtime]       # keyed by name
```

**Readiness is decided by the runtime's log, not by the port.** Observed on mlx-lm 0.31.3:
on a model-load failure the server still binds its port and logs `Starting httpd` after the
load thread has died, so a client POST connects and then hangs forever. Poll `/v1/models`
for the model id *and* watch the log for a load error.

Each runtime names identical weights differently (`mlx-community/X`, `mlx-community__X`,
`omlx/X`, `<artifact_dir>`, `<artifact_dir>:no-think`). `model_id` on the `Handle` is the
resolved one.

## `ohyesmlx/sample.py` — issue #4, **merged, do not change**

```python
sampler = Sampler(pid, interval_s=1.0).start()
result = sampler.stop()
# {"peak_mb": float, "samples": [{"t": float, "mb": float}], "n_samples": int,
#  "duration_s": float, "memory_split": {...}, "power": {...},
#  "gpu_wired_limit": {...}, "error": str | None}
```

## `ohyesmlx/measure.py` — issue #5

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Cell:
    id: str                        # "<format>__<runtime>"
    runtime: str                   # key into RUNTIMES
    artifact_dir: str
    label: str                     # human name for the format

@dataclass
class CellResult:
    cell: Cell
    status: str                    # "PASS" | "FAIL" | "N/A"
    reason: str | None
    observations: list[Observation]   # EVERY raw sample. Never truncated.
    cold_load_s: float | None
    memory: dict                   # the sample.py result dict
    runtime_version: str | None
    disk_bytes: int | None

def run_cells(cells: list[Cell], workload: dict, *,
              warmup: int = 3, measured: int = 5,
              max_tokens: int = 256, cooldown_s: float = 30.0,
              results_dir: str) -> list[CellResult]: ...
```

**Exactly one runtime may hold weights at any moment.** `run_cells` stops the current
runtime and confirms its port is free before starting the next. Two resident 20 GB models
on a 64 GB machine saturate unified memory and quietly poison every number in the run
while the run still completes and still looks plausible.

Cell order is **interleaved**, never config order — otherwise thermal drift aliases
perfectly onto runtime identity. Persist after every cell. `max_tokens` is fixed so tok/s
is never compared across different generation lengths.

## `ohyesmlx/report.py` — issue #6

```python
def summarize(results: list[CellResult]) -> list[dict]: ...
# one row per cell: ttft_p50_s/p90/p99, itl_s, decode_tps, prefill_tps,
# cold_load_s, peak_mb, disk_bytes, runtime_version, status

def render_markdown(rows: list[dict], *, axis: str) -> str: ...      # axis: "runtime" | "format"
```

**`measure.py` owns `results.jsonl`, and is the only thing that writes it.** The
serializer (`write_jsonl`, and the per-cell record it builds) lives in `measure.py`
alongside `CellResult`, which owns the shape. `run_cells` calls it after every cell so a
run that dies still has its completed cells on disk; `report.py` imports it if it needs
it, and never defines a second one.

Two writers for one artifact is the exact pattern this project exists to avoid.

### The raw record stays raw

```python
def write_jsonl(results: list[CellResult], path: str, *, run: dict) -> None: ...
```

Line 1 of the file is the **run header**: the pins (`temperature`, `seed`, `max_tokens`,
`warmup`, `measured`, `cooldown_s`, `workload`). Every line after it is one cell.

A stored observation carries **only the `Observation` fields** — never `decode_tps`,
`prefill_tps`, or `itl_s`. Those are derived, and `report.summarize` computes them from the
raw fields on read. Storing a derived value beside the raw values it comes from creates two
sources of truth for one metric, and when they disagree there is no way to say which is
right. That disagreement is not hypothetical: it is how the predecessor reported 243.5 and
57.2 tok/s for the same cell on consecutive runs.

`CellResult` carries `warmup_observations: list[Observation]` alongside `observations`.
Warmups are discarded from the summary, never from the record — they are how a cold-start
anomaly is spotted after the fact.

`axis` is required, and `render_markdown` emits the caveat naming what that axis cannot
claim. A table that does not say which variable it held constant is not a result.

## Metric formulas — one definition each, no forks

```
decode_tps  = completion_tokens / (last_content_s - ttft_s)
prefill_tps = prompt_tokens / ttft_s
itl_s       = (last_content_s - ttft_s) / max(1, completion_tokens - 1)
```

`completion_tokens` comes from `token_source` in priority order. Two ways to be exact,
one way to derive:

1. **`usage`** — the runtime reports the reasoning count itself, so content is the
   remainder.
2. **`usage`** — the runtime emitted no reasoning channel at all, so there is no split to
   derive and `completion_tokens` *is* the content count. The local tokenizer is not
   consulted.
3. **`local_tokenizer`** — the stream mixes both and the runtime reports one total, so the
   counter splits it, and the two parts must sum to that total **exactly**.

Never mix sources within one comparison, and never soften case 3 with a tolerance.

Case 2 is not a shortcut. Re-tokenizing decoded text is not the inverse of generation: a
response truncated at `max_tokens` re-tokenizes across different boundaries and lands a
token or two away. Measured — oMLX 0.6.4 generated 256, the local counter re-read the same
text as 257, and five coherent responses published no tok/s at all. The reconciliation in
case 3 validates a *derived split*; where nothing is derived there is nothing to validate,
and demanding the round-trip makes the metric unreachable rather than more honest.
