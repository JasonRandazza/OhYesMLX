# Module interfaces

Pinned so modules can be built concurrently without inventing mismatched shapes.
**These signatures are the contract.** If one is wrong, say so in the ticket and stop —
do not quietly change it, because three other modules are being written against it.

All types are plain dataclasses or dicts. Stdlib only.

## `ohyesmlx/transport.py` — issue #2

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Observation:
    """One measured request."""
    ok: bool
    error: str | None
    ttft_s: float | None            # send -> first CONTENT delta. Reasoning deltas excluded.
    last_content_s: float | None    # send -> final content delta
    total_s: float                  # send -> stream closed
    prompt_tokens: int | None       # from usage
    completion_tokens: int | None   # from usage, content only
    reasoning_tokens: int | None    # from usage.completion_tokens_details, if present
    content_event_count: int
    text: str
    token_source: str               # "usage" | "local_tokenizer" | "none"

def chat(base_url: str, model: str, messages: list[dict], *,
         max_tokens: int, temperature: float = 0.0, seed: int | None = None,
         timeout_s: float = 600.0,
         token_counter: "TokenCounter | None" = None) -> Observation: ...
```

`base_url` is `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1`. Streaming is always on internally with
`stream_options.include_usage`; `Observation` is what the caller sees.

**`token_counter` must be wired at every call site.** In the predecessor project the exact
token path existed, was never passed by any production caller, and
`median_decode_tokens_per_second` was therefore `None` in 100% of runs on disk.

```python
class TokenCounter:            # ohyesmlx/token_counter.py
    def __init__(self, model_dir: str): ...
    def count(self, text: str) -> int: ...
```

## `ohyesmlx/runtimes.py` — issue #3

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Runtime:
    name: str                      # "mlxlm" | "osaurus" | "omlx" | "optiq"
    port: int
    def start(self, artifact_dir: str, model_id: str) -> "Handle": ...

@dataclass
class Handle:
    pid: int
    port: int
    base_url: str                  # "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1"
    model_id: str                  # what THIS runtime calls the model
    version: str                   # runtime version, recorded as provenance
    cold_load_s: float             # spawn -> ready. Its own metric, never folded in.
    def stop(self) -> None: ...    # must not return until the port is free

RUNTIMES: dict[str, Runtime]       # keyed by name
```

**Readiness is decided by the runtime's log, not by the port.** Observed on mlx-lm 0.31.3:
on a model-load failure the server still binds its port and logs `Starting httpd` after the
load thread has died, so a client POST connects and then hangs forever. Poll `/v1/models`
for the model id *and* watch the log for a load error.

Each runtime names identical weights differently (`mlx-community/X`, `mlx-community__X`,
`omlx/X`, `<artifact_dir>`, `<artifact_dir>:no-think`). `model_id` on the `Handle` is the
resolved one.

## `ohyesmlx/sample.py` — issue #4, **merged, do not change**

```python
sampler = Sampler(pid, interval_s=1.0).start()
result = sampler.stop()
# {"peak_mb": float, "samples": [{"t": float, "mb": float}], "n_samples": int,
#  "duration_s": float, "memory_split": {...}, "power": {...},
#  "gpu_wired_limit": {...}, "error": str | None}
```

## `ohyesmlx/measure.py` — issue #5

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Cell:
    id: str                        # "<format>__<runtime>"
    runtime: str                   # key into RUNTIMES
    artifact_dir: str
    label: str                     # human name for the format

@dataclass
class CellResult:
    cell: Cell
    status: str                    # "PASS" | "FAIL" | "N/A"
    reason: str | None
    observations: list[Observation]   # EVERY raw sample. Never truncated.
    cold_load_s: float | None
    memory: dict                   # the sample.py result dict
    runtime_version: str | None
    disk_bytes: int | None

def run_cells(cells: list[Cell], workload: dict, *,
              warmup: int = 3, measured: int = 5,
              max_tokens: int = 256, cooldown_s: float = 30.0,
              results_dir: str) -> list[CellResult]: ...
```

**Exactly one runtime may hold weights at any moment.** `run_cells` stops the current
runtime and confirms its port is free before starting the next. Two resident 20 GB models
on a 64 GB machine saturate unified memory and quietly poison every number in the run
while the run still completes and still looks plausible.

Cell order is **interleaved**, never config order — otherwise thermal drift aliases
perfectly onto runtime identity. Persist after every cell. `max_tokens` is fixed so tok/s
is never compared across different generation lengths.

## `ohyesmlx/report.py` — issue #6

```python
def summarize(results: list[CellResult]) -> list[dict]: ...
# one row per cell: ttft_p50_s/p90/p99, itl_s, decode_tps, prefill_tps,
# cold_load_s, peak_mb, disk_bytes, runtime_version, status

def write_jsonl(results: list[CellResult], path: str) -> None: ...   # raw observations included
def render_markdown(rows: list[dict], *, axis: str) -> str: ...      # axis: "runtime" | "format"
```

`axis` is required, and `render_markdown` emits the caveat naming what that axis cannot
claim. A table that does not say which variable it held constant is not a result.

## Metric formulas — one definition each, no forks

```
decode_tps  = completion_tokens / (last_content_s - ttft_s)
prefill_tps = prompt_tokens / ttft_s
itl_s       = (last_content_s - ttft_s) / max(1, completion_tokens - 1)
```

`completion_tokens` comes from `token_source` in priority order: the runtime's `usage`
only when it separates reasoning from content, else the local tokenizer. Never mix sources
within one comparison.
