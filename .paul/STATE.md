# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .paul/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-14)

**Core value:** A Mac user can find out whether their serving runtime or their quantization is what's actually costing them speed and memory.
**Current focus:** v1 — Phase 3, the sparse grid on Qwen3.5-4B

## Current Position

Milestone: v1 — The sparse format x runtime grid on small models (0.1.0)
Phase: 4 of 6 (256-expert question) — answered; Phase 3 next
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Applying
Last activity: 2026-09-15 — Phase 2.1 closed. Harness run against real servers for the first time; Phase 4 answered out of order because it cost no downloads.

Progress:
- Milestone: [█████░░░░░] 50%
- Phase: [██████████] 100%

## Loop Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Two single-variable studies replace LMRE's native diagonal | Pre-phase | Every run declares which axis it varies; nothing varies both. |
| PAUL is the only process spine | Pre-phase | No CONTEXT.md, no ADRs, no handoff docs, no wayfinder. This file is the only state store. |
| Speed + memory only in v1 | Pre-phase | Accuracy work is refused until v1 ships, however tempting. |
| Hero model is `gemma-4-12B-it-qat` | Pre-phase | Zero downloads; 36 GiB free disk forbids more. |
| `--cells a,b,c` is the only cell selector | Pre-phase | Any second mechanism gets deleted on sight. |
| Implementation delegated to `cc-agent` (deepseek-v4.1-flash, max effort) | Pre-phase | Opus reviews every diff and every test run personally; worker prose is not evidence. |
| Hero models are `Qwen3.5-4B` + `LFM2.5-8B-A1B` | Phase 1 | `gemma4_unified` is not shipped by mlx-lm, so that family can carry no stock-mlx control. 33.7 GB for both, all four formats each. |
| Format axis ships before runtime axis | Phase 1 | `mlx-Chronos` already published a runtime-axis protocol; nobody has done the format axis properly. |
| A cell emitting garbage FAILS, however fast | Phase 1 | Stock mlx-lm loaded a 256-expert oQ4 MoE, hit full throughput, and returned token salad with nothing raised. |
| JANG is a runtime+format bundle, not an axis point | Phase 1 | No runtime loads JANG and the other formats both. Own study, after v1. |
| A grid contains both axes as its slices | Phase 3 | Rows (one format, many runtimes) are the runtime axis; columns (one runtime, many formats) are the format axis; the best cell is a recommendation. Attribute within a row or column, recommend across the whole. The two axes were never alternatives to the diagonal — they are readings of one measurement. |
| Three workloads, never averaged | Phase 3 | chat/prefill/decode. One shape measures one corner and prefill-heavy and decode-heavy work can have different winners. A richer suite is v2's. |
| Floors then one ordering metric, never a blended score | Phase 3 | Weighting speed against memory has no objective answer, so a single number would encode an arbitrary trade-off as though it were measured. Full metric card behind every ranking. |
| Osaurus and vMLX are two independent JANG runtimes, both kept | Phase 3 | JANG cannot be a format-axis row, but JANG-on-Osaurus vs JANG-on-vMLX is the runtime axis with format held constant. Two implementations are what make a single-variable JANG study possible at all. |
| The 256-expert failure is runtime-specific, not format-specific | Phase 4 | oMLX 0.6.4 answers coherently from the same bytes stock mlx-lm turns into salad. The format axis is not built on a corrupting quantizer. |
| A server's self-reported tok/s is not a measurement | Phase 4 | oMLX reports 15,286 tok/s from a generation_duration of 0.0. The harness measures; it does not relay. |

### Deferred Issues

| Issue | Origin | Effort | Revisit |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| LMRE not yet archived to ~/Dev/archive/ | Pre-phase | S | After Phase 4, once nothing more is needed from it |
| Disk audit incomplete — two workers hit the turn cap | Phase 2.1 | S | Low urgency: both hero models fit in 36 GiB without deleting anything |
| ~~LMRE's rubric/ruling design not ported~~ **PULLED FORWARD 2026-09-15** | Pre-phase | — | Floors + one ordering metric now pinned in docs/interfaces.md. The accuracy axis stays in v2; only the honest half moved. |
| No CI | Pre-phase | S | Before the repo gets its first outside contributor |
| Tokenizer-unavailable should make a cell N/A, not 5 transport failures | Phase 4 | S | measure.py's docstring promises visible N/A; behaviour gives FAIL with a server-shaped reason |
| ~~`mlx-lm` 0.31.3 lives only in `/tmp/mlxspike`~~ **RESOLVED 2026-09-15** | Phase 4 | — | Reinstalled at `~/.local/share/ohyesmlx/mlx-lm-0.31.3` with the spike's exact pins (mlx 0.32.2, transformers 5.17.0, tokenizers 0.23.2, numpy 2.5.3). |

### Blockers/Concerns

| Blocker | Impact | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| ~~Stock mlx-lm executes a 256-expert oQ4 MoE incorrectly~~ **RESOLVED Phase 4** | Was: invalidates any speed number taken without a coherence check | Runtime-specific, not format-specific. oMLX serves the same bytes coherently. Gate catches it. `docs/research/2026-09-15-phase4-256-expert.md` |
| ~~36 GiB free~~ **RESOLVED 2026-09-15** | Was: caps model choice | 312 GiB free after Jason cleared JANG models and deleted the Time Machine local snapshots that were pinning the blocks. Phase 3 is unconstrained. |

## Boundaries (Active)

- `.paul/STATE.md` is the only project state store. If a second appears, delete it.
- No new dependency without naming what it replaces.
- No governance layer: no plan hashing, no sealed evidence, no action grants, no workspace scaffolding.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-09-15
Stopped at: Phase 2.1 closed (#7). Harness driven against real servers for the first time across three runs; each exposed a defect, each fixed. Phase 4 answered: the 256-expert failure is the runtime, not the format.
Next action: Phase 3 in five steps — (1) download Qwen3.5-4B five formats + probe loadability, (2) vMLX Runtime subclass, (3) three workloads, (4) floors/ranking/metric card, (5) run the grid. Steps 2 and 3 are in flight; 1 is downloading.
Resume context: **Read `.paul/HANDOFF.md` first** — it carries the three findings that redirected the project, the traps that cost time, and machine state.
